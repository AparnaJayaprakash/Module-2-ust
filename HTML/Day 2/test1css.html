            The Minions are small, yellow, capsule shaped creatures, who have one or two eyes.
            They are the signature characters of the Despicable Me series, as well as the official mascots for Illumination. 
            They bring much of the comedy in the film, and they are known as the scene-stealer of the movie.
            <span>Frequently, they speak in an incomprehensible language, called Minionese,</span> occasionally switching to English.
            They are much childish in some ways, yet they seem to be very intelligent in certain aspects.
            All the minions are supporting characters in Minions (with the exception of Kevin, Stuart, and Bob), major characters 
            in Despicable Me and Despicable Me 2 and supporting characters in Despicable Me 3 (with the exception of Mel).

            They are impulsive creatures with little self-control, but with a wide-eyed wonder 
            and odd innocence that endears them to viewers and makes them relatable. 
            <span>They can be pesky when they are doing weird interactions with other people, animals, or 
            objects; they are also famous for their gibberish-speaking language.</span> Minions have standard
            English names (see below).
            Unlike most other criminal masterminds and their usual doctrine of abusing their henchmen, Gru gets along famously with the minions. 
            He genuinely seems to like them and shows appreciation for their hard work and support, only
            having to be strict with them very few times. He even seems to know each of them by name.

            As a rambunctious bunch of simple-minded homunculi, Minions are a similar size and shape but have unique features to tell them apart,
            such as height, number of eyes, roundness or secondary features such as hair, eye/pupil size or clothing.
            <span>Minions are yellow and wear black gloves, small black boots, metal goggles accommodating their number of eyes, and blue jean overalls
            with Gru's emblem on the fronts.</span> possess few additional physiological characteristics; with a crack and a shake, they can double as 
            glow sticks for activities in the dark, such as going through ventilation ducts. They additionally can survive without air, as one is seen in outer space without oxygen in Despicable Me.
